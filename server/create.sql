The first art-rock album, it merges dreamy, druggy balladry with raw and uncompromising sonic experimentation, and is famously clothed in that Andy Warhol-designed banana sleeve. Lou Reeds lyrics depicted a Warholian New York demi-monde where hard drugs and sexual experimentation held sway. Shocking then, and still utterly transfixing.', 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/very-good-albums.appspot.com/o/band_images%2Fvelvet_1.webp?alt=media&token=43da8b38-579b-4dd0-86ca-ac31cb094090', 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/very-good-albums.appspot.com/o/band_images%2Fvelvet_2.jpeg?alt=media&token=0372c18d-27ed-490b-adf2-89f7a482e3db', 'The Velvet Underground were largely ignored during heir original run from the mid-''60s into the early ''70s, but few bands would cast as long a shadow in terms of innovation and influence. Playing music that was boldly uncompromising both sonically and lyrically, the Velvet Underground infused rock & roll with the daring of the avant-garde and the poetic realism of post-beat literature. Too far ahead of their time for pop music''s mainstream, the VU made a profound impression on thoughtful listeners, many of whom would go on to make groundbreaking music of their own, and they would belatedly be acknowledged as one of rock''s most important groups. Their four studio albums -- 1967''s The Velvet Underground & Nico, 1968''s White Light/White Heat, 1969''s The Velvet Underground, and 1970''s Loaded -- are all essential documents, and 2015''s The Complete Matrix Tapes is superb evidence of their power as a live act.', 'Sunday morning, brings the dawn in It''s just a restless feeling by my side Early dawning, Sunday morning It''s just the wasted years so close behind', 'The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in New York City in 1964. The original line-up consisted of singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus MacLise. MacLise was replaced by Moe Tucker in 1965, who played on most of the band''s recordings. Their integration of rock and the avant-garde achieved little commercial success during the group''s existence, but they are now recognized as one of the most influential bands in rock, underground, experimental, and alternative music. The group''s provocative subject matter, musical experiments, and often nihilistic attitudes also proved influential in the development of punk rock and new wave music.'

But Sgt Pepper''s made the watertight case for pop music as an art form in itself; until then, it was thought the silly, transient stuff of teenagers. At a time when all pop music was stringently manufactured, these Paul McCartney-driven melodies and George Martin-produced whorls of sound proved that untried ground was not only the most fertile stuff, but also the most viable commercially. It defined the Sixties and - for good and ill - gave white rock all its airs and graces.', 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/very-good-albums.appspot.com/o/band_images%2Fbeatles1.jpeg?alt=media&token=0822adaf-f12e-4506-a98e-c97b62d58b87', 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/very-good-albums.appspot.com/o/band_images%2Fbeatles2.jpeg?alt=media&token=1a4842cb-d1ac-435c-aeca-9e7d387b4aa0', 'The Beatles recorded together for a little over seven years. Between October 1962 and May 1970, they released thirteen albums and a number of tracks issued on standalone singles. The catalogue created in that short period has sold more than that of any other group in history and its commercial success continues - the world’s best selling album during the first decade of the 21st century was a collection of The Beatles’ chart-topping singles called 1. But the group’s significance stems not just from huge sales figures. Their music has inspired generation upon generation of musicians, songwriters and producers. As Mark Ronson put it: ‘Everything we take for granted - they absolutely invented it.’ Tom Petty was a teenager during the years The Beatles’ records appeared in quick succession: ‘They were just out in front. There was The Beatles …and then there was everyone else. And everyone else could be great, but The Beatles were leading the way and that’s just irrefutably true.’', 'Picture yourself in a boat on a river

A girl with kaleidoscope eyes', 'The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music''s recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock ''n'' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era''s youth and sociocultural movements'
